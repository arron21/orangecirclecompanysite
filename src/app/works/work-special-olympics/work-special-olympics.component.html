  <p>The Special Olympics GMS project is something we feel very fortunate to be part of.
    It was an AngularJS frontend that connected with a Microsoft build API for gathering and organizing athlete data.</p>
  <p>The application allows users to select a Delegation or select a Sport, and then from there view athletes results.</p>
  <h3>Our Role</h3>
  <p>We worked on 2 aspects of the project.</p>

  <h5>The Artwork</h5>
  <p>We prepared the dozens of Adobe illustrator vector files and converted them into web ready images for each of the sports</p>

  <h5>The Frontend</h5>
  <p>We also helped build the Frontend of the application. It is built with Uikit and custom CSS that we developed based on the designs of some talented designers.</p>
